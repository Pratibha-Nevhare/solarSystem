# solarSystem

This project is a simple solar system simulation created using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It visualizes the relationship between the sun, the earth, and the moon, providing an interactive representation of their orbits.

Overview
The Solar System Simulation leverages CSS animations and positioning to create the illusion of planetary orbits. It showcases the relative movements of the sun, earth, and moon, offering a basic but informative visualization of celestial dynamics.

Features :
Realistic Orbits: Demonstrates the orbits of the earth and the moon around the sun, following the laws of planetary motion.
Visual Representation: Provides a visually appealing representation of the solar system, including the sun, earth, and moon.
Interactive Elements: Allows users to observe the motion of celestial bodies and gain insights into their relative positions.

Technologies Used :
HTML: Utilized for structuring the content and elements of the solar system simulation.
CSS: Provides styling and animations to create the visual representation of planetary orbits.
